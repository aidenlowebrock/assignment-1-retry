<p><strong>Name:</strong> Aiden Lowe-Brock<br>
<strong>Login:</strong> jc429323</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>the goal for the website is to attract a younger audience aged around high school to young adults and get more people interested in a cosplay group by making the website attractive but easy to navigate.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>at the moment there is only about 30 people aged between 35-50 going to the parties held by Cossieplay. if the website is succsessful then there would be more people of a younger age attending these parties monthly and also more costumes being ordered by the company therefore, improving the buisness</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>the targeted audience is high school kids and young adults as there are not many young people going to the cossieplay parties.</p>
