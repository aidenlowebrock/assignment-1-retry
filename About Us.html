<h2>About us</h2>
<h2>What is CosPlay?</h2>
<p>Cosplay, a portmanteau  of the words costume play, is a performance art in which participants called  cosplayers wear costumes and fashion accessories to represent a specific  character. Cosplayers often interact to create a subculture and a broader use  of the term &quot;cosplay&quot; applies to any costumed role-playing in venues  apart from the stage. Any entity that lends itself to dramatic interpretation  may be taken up as a subject and it is not unusual to see genders switched.  Favorite sources include manga and anime, comic books and cartoons, video  games, and live-action films and television series.</p>
<p>The rapid  growth in the number of people cosplaying as a hobby since 1990 has made the  phenomenon a significant aspect of popular culture in Japan and some other  parts of Asia and in the Western world. Cosplay events are common features of  fan conventions and there are also dedicated conventions and local and  international competitions, as well as social networks, websites and other  forms of media centered on cosplay activities.<br>

<h2>About CossiePlay</h2>
<p>CossiePlay  is a family-run business, operating in Hulkstown since 2012. We create  outstanding custom-made costumes. Cosplayers can order any kind of costume -  from simple Spiderman or elf costumes right up to costumes including advanced  features like armour, animatronics, realistic weaponry and working force  fields. Depending on the difficulty, costumes take between 1 and 50 weeks and  cost between $10 and $10,000.<br>
  We buy and sell second-hand costumes (a price list is  available) as well.<br>
  On the first Saturday of every month we hold a &ldquo;CossiePlay  Party&rdquo; at the town hall. Entry is $15 for adults, $10 for ages 6-17 and kids  under 6 are free. Each entry includes one non-alcoholic drink and a glow stick.  Parties start at 6pm and run until 11pm. There is always a live DJ at the party  (who takes requests) and dancing is common (but not required). </p>
<h2>Party Guidelines</h2>
<p>CossiePlay party-goers party at their own risk and are  responsible for their own safety. Check with your doctor before you party hard.<br>
  Party fees must be paid at the door. Cash or EFTPOS  accepted. Credit card payments attract a 2% surcharge. Alcohol is served at the  bar to over 18s only. No intoxicated persons will be served, but will be escorted  to a taxi â€“ paid by the party-goer.</p>
